# Computer Networks: transport layer implementation

Project realized during Computer Network classes, my assignment was to develop a program that establishes a connection with a designated server and sends UDP packets to fetch a file of specified size from the server.

### Usage

1. `make`
2. `./transport IP PORT FILE_NAME FILE_SIZE`
